## Introduction

Ever wish that JavaScript had less symbols and more dogs? We did, so we made PawvaScript!

PawvaScript is an object-oriented scripting language designed to make JavaScript more programmer-friendly (so friendly that your dog could learn it, probably). PawvaScript draws on many fundamentals from JavaScript but replaces confusing symbols with clear and (dog-friendly) readable terms, adds types (like TypeScript) to help with debugging, and throws in some paw-sitively awesome dog-related keywords just for fun and tail wags.

## Example Programs

### The Basics

Let's start with the classic Hello, World:

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

woof "Hello, World!";                                               console.log("Hello, World!");
bark "my ball!";                                                    console.log("my ball".toUpperCase());
howl "uh-oh"                                                        console.error("uh-oh");
```

### Types

PawvaScript's primitive types are similar to JavaScripts, and it also has data structures like Python's lists and dictionaries.

| PawvaScript | Javascript/Python |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| goodBoy     | boolean           |
| leash       | string            |
| toeBeans    | number            |
| trick       | function          |
| pack        | array/list        |
| kennel      | map/dictionary    |
| breed       | class/object      |

### Variable Declaration and Assignment

Variables are declared with their type.

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

leash dogName is "Cece";                                            let dogName = "Cece";

toeBeans dogAge is 12;                                              let dogAge = 12;

goodBoy isGoodBoy is good;                                          let isGoodBoy = true;

goodBoy isNaughtyDoggo is bad;                                      let isNaughtyDoggo = false;

pack[leash] dogNames is ["Cece", "Fluffy"];                         let dogNames = ["Cece", "Fluffy"];

kennel[leash:toeBeans] dogAges is ["Cece": 1, "Fluffy": 2];         let dogAges = {"Cece": 1, "Fluffy": 2};

!!! this has a default initialization of 0 !!!
toeBeans cuteness;                                                  let cuteness = 0;
cuteness is 100;                                                    cuteness = 100;

!!! cat is the equivalent of null; any type can have the value cat. !!!
leash theBestestDog is cat;                                         let theBestestDog = null;
```

### Leashes/Strings

PawvaScript supports leash interpolation and concetation:

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

leash dogName is "Ce" with "Ce";                                    let dogName = "Ce" + "Ce";

leash sentence is "![dogName] is the best dog";                     let sentence = `${dogName} is the best dog`;
```

### Packs/Lists

Packs are the PawvaScript equivalent of lists in Python or arrays in JavaScript:

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

pack[leash] goodDogs is ["CeCe", "Buster", "Muffin"];               let goodDogs = ["CeCe", "Buster", "Muffin"];

!!! The without keyword can remove elements from a pack. !!!
pack[leash] bestDogs is goodDogs without "Muffin";                  let bestDogs = goodDogs;
                                                                    const indexOfMuffin = goodDogs.indexOf("Muffin");
                                                                    if (indexOfMuffin > -1) {
                                                                         bestDogs.splice(indexOfMuffin, 1);
                                                                    }

!!! The peanutButter keyword is the equivalent of JavaScript's spread syntax. !!!
pack[leash] sm0lDogs is ["Tiny", "Teenie", "Boo"];                  let sm0lDogs = ["Tiny", "Teenie", "Boo"];
pack[leash] b1gDogs is ["Boofer", "Woofer," "Mo"];                  let b1gDogs = ["Boofer", "Woofer," "Mo"];
pack[leash] allTheDogs is [                                         let allTheDogs = [
    peanutButter sm0lDogs,                                              ...sm0lDogs,
    peanutButter b1gDogs                                                ...b1gDogs
];                                                                  ];

woof allTheDogs;                                                    console.log(allTheDogs);
!!! ["Tiny", "Teenie", "Boo", "Boofer", "Woofer," "Mo"] !!!         /* ["Tiny", "Teenie", "Boo", "Boofer", "Woofer," "Mo"] */

pack[toeBeans] ages is [1, 1, 2];                                   let ages = [1, 1, 2];
```

### Kennels/Maps

Kennels are data structures like Python dictionaries.

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

kennel[leash:leash] goodDogs is [                                   let goodDogs = {
    "CeCe": "German Shepherd",                                          CeCe: "German Shepherd",
    "Buster": "Golden Doodle",                                          Buster: "Golden Doodle",
    "Mo": "Potato"                                                      Mo: "Potato"
];                                                                  };
kennel[leash:toeBeans] ages is ["CeCe": 1, "Buster": 1, "Mo": 5];   let ages = {CeCe: 1, Buster: 1, Mo: 5};
```

### Relational Operators

Wanna compare stuff?

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

goodBoy a is x equals y;                                            let a = x === y;

a is x notEquals y;                                                 a = x !== y;

a is x isGreaterThan y;                                             a = x > y;

a is x isLessThan y;                                                a = x < y;

a is x isAtLeast y;                                                 a = x >= y;

a is x isAtMost y;                                                  a = x <= y;
```

### Arithmetic Operators

PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

toeBeans a is x + y;                                                a = x + y;

a is x - y;                                                         a = x - y;

a is x * y;                                                         a = x * y;

a is x / y;                                                         a = x / y;

a is x mod y;                                                       a = x % y;

a is x!;                                                            a = x!;

a is -x;                                                            a = -x;
```

### Conditional Statements

### Tricks

Let's find the greatest common divisor between two toeBeans!

```JavaScript
PAWVASCRIPT                                                         JAVASCRIPT

trick gcd chews[toeBeans:num1, toeBeans:num2] fetches toeBeans:     function gcd(num1, num2) {
    toeBeans remainder;                                                 let remainder;
    chases while (a mod b) isGreaterThan 0:                             while ((num1 % num2) > 0) {
        remainder is (a mod b);                                             remainder = a % b;
        a is b;                                                             a = b;
        b is remainder;                                                     b = remainder;
    tail                                                                }

### Breeds

Let's make an owner breed!

(lucille's introduceDog)() !!! output: "My dog's name is Cece" !!!    lucille.introduceDog();
woof lucille's command()  !!! output: "Cece, stay." !!!             console.log(lucille.command());
```
